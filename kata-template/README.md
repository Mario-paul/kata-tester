# kata-template

Copy this directory into the correct level kyu directory of your kata, and prep the file according to the main [README.md](https://github.com/Mario-paul/kata-tester/blob/main/README.md) file.

## .js Files Explained

- ### kata.js

    This file is the working / testing environment for katas. It's where you play around with code to find a solution, just like the IDE on Codewars. It's generally full of console.logs() useful for debugging. You can clean it and submit to Codewars, and delete the optional .js files.

- ### clean.js (optional)

    "Production" version of your code. Clean your code of console.logs(), comments, and make it as readable as possible. This will be the final version of the kata you will submit on Codewars. Does not need sample tests or environment settings, but it can if you want.

- ### explain.js (optional)

    Copy your clean.js here and comment out / explain what the code does. Useful for future reference. Does not need sample test code or environment settings.

- ### refactored.js (optional)

    A refactored version of the clean code, made to be as efficient as possible. One liners, and clever solutions might go here. Does not need sample tests or environment settings, but it can if you want.

- ### `INSTRUCTIONS.md`

    Copy and paste the instructions in the Codewars kata here. You may open it to be side by side with your kata file in order to reference it as you code.
